               <div class="about-text">Hi, my names Jose. I’m 25 years, born and raised in Arizona. I’ve always had an interest in technology and design which led me to web development. While I’ve never considered myself a “tech guy” and an “artist”, growing up I always enjoyed art and computers. Slowly as the internet has evolved, I’ve seen website designs change as well. I am a full stack developer specializing and working on HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS. I’m currently working on my craft to make a career change into a growing industry.</div>

               <div class="about-text">I’m a huge dog lover. Anubis is my 4 (almost 5) year old Doberman. Anyone that knows me knows he is basically my son. Apart from him, I enjoy spending my time with my amazing girlfriend, Jessica, and staying active. Being that I spend a lot of time behind a computer screen, I love being outside and go to the gym 5-6 times a week. In my down time I do enjoy reading as well as playing video games. </div>
